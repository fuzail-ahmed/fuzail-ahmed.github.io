### 💻 Backend Engineer (Golang) · 12+ Years Experience

I’m a Backend Engineer with **12+ years of experience**, including **5 years of hands-on work with Golang**, building and operating production-grade systems at scale.

I enjoy designing services that are **fast, reliable, and easy to reason about**—and seeing them deliver real impact in production. I’m particularly drawn to solving complex backend problems where correctness, scalability, and operational clarity matter.

### Core Experience & Impact

Over the years, I’ve worked across the full Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), owning features from initial design to deployment and long-term production support.

At **Seagate (Lyve Cloud)**, I played a key role in building and modernizing backend services:

- **Technology Modernization:** Designed and maintained services using **Golang, gRPC, Docker, and Kubernetes**
- **End-to-End Ownership:** Owned the **Ticketing System microservice**, integrating it deeply with Salesforce and internal workflows, directly contributing to operational efficiency and revenue-impacting features
- **Performance & Reliability:** Improved API performance and contributed to critical **billing** and **authentication** modules used in production

I’m known for strong ownership and the ability to move seamlessly from technical design discussions to hands-on implementation. I enjoy mentoring developers and helping teams adopt clean, maintainable backend practices.

### Technical Strengths

| Area | Focus |
|---|---|
| **Backend** | Golang (Primary), gRPC, REST, PostgreSQL, MySQL |
| **Cloud & DevOps** | Kubernetes, Docker, AWS, Helm, CI/CD |
| **Architecture** | Microservices, Distributed Systems, Clean Architecture, Redis |
| **Engineering Practices** | Design reviews, production readiness, testing, mentoring |

### How I Think About Engineering

I value:
- Clear interfaces over clever abstractions  
- Observability and operability as first-class concerns  
- Simple designs that scale before complex ones  
- Owning systems beyond just “shipping code”

### Looking Ahead

I’m currently exploring opportunities as a **Backend Engineer (Golang)** or **Cloud-Native Engineer**, working on systems that demand high scalability, reliability, and thoughtful engineering.

If you’re building serious backend systems and value engineers who take ownership and deliver with care, I’d be happy to connect.
